django-golifescience
====================

Before I discovered Pelican the golifescience site was built on top of Django,
and went through a number of iterations as part of previous now-defunct projects. As a
result there is a stash of reasonably useful Django code sitting in a repo.

It's released here for archive purposes and as Django free-for-all. If you would like to 
use any of the code contained within, please do. If you would like to help package any
up into releaseable Django apps, please let me know.
